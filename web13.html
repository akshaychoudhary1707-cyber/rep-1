    <h1> THE FERMI PARADOX </h1>
    <p1> <b> The Fermi paradox is the discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of advanced extraterrestrial life and the apparently high likelihood of its existence.Those affirming the paradox generally conclude that if the conditions required for life to arise from non-living matter are as permissive as the available evidence on Earth indicates, then extraterrestrial life would be sufficiently common such that it would be implausible for it not to have been detected.</b></p1>

    <div class="intro">  <br><p>The Fermi paradox is the apparent contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial civilizations existing and the lack of observable evidence for them. It questions "Where is everybody?" given the vastness of the universe, the numerous stars and planets, and the immense amount of time for life to develop. The paradox highlights that either intelligent extraterrestrial life is rare, or there's a reason why we haven't detected it.</p> <br><br></div>
