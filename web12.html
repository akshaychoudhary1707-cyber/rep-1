    <h1> THE FERMI PARADOX </h1>
    <p1> <b> The Fermi paradox is the discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of advanced extraterrestrial life and the apparently high likelihood of its existence.Those affirming the paradox generally conclude that if the conditions required for life to arise from non-living matter are as permissive as the available evidence on Earth indicates, then extraterrestrial life would be sufficiently common such that it would be implausible for it not to have been detected.</b></p1>
    <br><br>
    <p2> <b> The paradox is named after physicist Enrico Fermi, who informally posed the question—often remembered as "Where is everybody?"—during a 1950 conversation at Los Alamos with colleagues Emil Konopinski, Edward Teller, and Herbert York. The paradox first appeared in print in a 1963 paper by Carl Sagan and the paradox has since been fully characterized by scientists including Michael H. Hart. Early formulations of the paradox have also been identified in writings by Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle (1686) and Jules Verne (1865)</b></p2>
